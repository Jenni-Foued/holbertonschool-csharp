# <div align="center">C# - Text-based Interface</div>

In this project, we’ll be using all of the collective Foundations and C# skills we’ve gained to create a console application that allows a user to manage inventories of items.

- Data will be stored in JSON format.
- Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete objects.
- The class and attribute names used in this application will be generic, making it versatile for different use cases and easily extended.
